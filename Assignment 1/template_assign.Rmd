### Excercise 1.1
## a
The data seems to be normally disributed, one can project a bell curve on the
histogram and the QQplot results in a straight line. In addition the Shapiro-Wilk
test results in p-value > 0.05. Lastly the point estimate fo mu is computed:

```{r}
data=read.table(file="birthweight.txt",header=TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,2)); hist(data$birthweight); qqnorm(data$birthweight)
shapiro.test(data$birthweight)
mean(data$birthweight)
```

## b

```{r}
n = length(data$birthweight)
mu = mean(data$birthweight)
sd = sd(data$birthweight)
t = qt(p=0.05, df=(n -1), lower.tail=FALSE)

ci = t * sd / sqrt(n - 1); ci
lower_bound = mu - ci; lower_bound
upper_bound = mu + ci; upper_bound
```

Bounded 90% confidence interval = 2828.62  < mu < 2997.96

## c
```{r}
t.test(data, mu = 2800, alternative = "greater")
```

The 95% confidence interval doesnâ€™t overlap with 2800, lower bound is higher. 
So expert's claim is verified.

## d
This is a one-sided test because we are only interesten in the mean being greater 
than 2800. The upper bound is irrelevant thus it can be set to infinity. This is 
why the confidence interval shifts a little bit, there is a slight chance that 
the actual mean is above the upper bound found in 1.1b.

### Excercise 1.2
## a
Point estimate for p = x/n = 140/200 = 0.7

## b
For the calculation of the standard deviation a pseudo dataset was created in R.
For the t-value 2.62 was consevatively selected from the table using 100 df.
```{r}
a = matrix(0, 60, 1)
b = matrix(1, 140,1)
d = c(a,b)
sd = sd(d) 
n = 200
mu = 0.7
t = 2.626

ci = t * sd / sqrt(n - 1); ci
lower_bound = mu - ci; lower_bound
upper_bound = mu + ci; upper_bound
```

Bounded 99% confidence interval = 0.614  < mu < 0.786

## c
For alfa = 0.1 the p-value = 0.1254 (p > 0.05), thus the null hypothesis cannot 
be rejected. For other alfa-values, the p-value remains the same, only the 
confidence interval changes. Higher alfa-values result in smaller intervals. 
This makes sense because you allow for more uncertainty when creating the interval.
```{r}

t.test(d, mu=.75, conf.level = .99)

t.test(d, mu=.75, conf.level = .999)[4]
t.test(d, mu=.75, conf.level = .95)[4]
t.test(d, mu=.75, conf.level = .90)[4]
t.test(d, mu=.75, conf.level = .80)[4]
```

## Introduction to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax 
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown files permit 
you to interweave R code with ordinary text to produce well-formatted 
data analysis reports that are easy to modify. The R Markdown file itself 
shows the readers exactly how you got the results in your report.
For more details on using R Markdown 
see [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that 
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks 
within the document. For inline R code, surround code with back ticks and r. 
R replaces inline code with its results. For example, two plus one is `r 2+1`;
for the build-in R dataset `cars`, there were `r nrow(cars)` 
cars studied. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

### Figures

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=3.5}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to 
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. Use knitr options 
to style the output of a chunk. Place options in brackets above the chunk.
Other options with the defaults are: the `eval=FALSE` option just displays 
the R code (and does not run it); `warning=TRUE` whether to display 
warnings; `tidy=TRUE` wraps long code so it does not run off the page.

You can control the size and placement of figures. For example, 
you can put two figures (or more) next to each other. 
Use `par(mfrow=c(n,m))` to create `n` by `m` plots in one picture in R.
You can adjust the proportions of figures by using the `fig.width` 
and `fig.height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, 
and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.
Chunk option `fig.align`  takes values `left`, `right`, or `center` 
(to align figures in the output document).

```{r,fig.margin = TRUE,fig.width=6,fig.height=3,fig.align="center"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)); x1=rnorm(50); hist(x1); qqnorm(x1)
```

You can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using 
the `fig.fullwidth` chunk option. 

```{r,fig.fullwidth=TRUE,fig.height=3}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Petal.Length,xlab="Sepal.Length",ylab="Petal.Length")
```

More about chunk options can be found at [\textcolor{blue}{https://yihui.name/knitr/options/}](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

### Equations

You can also include \LaTeX\ expessions/equations in your report:
inline $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$ and 
in the display mode:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).
\]
To possibly avoid \LaTeX\ expressions in you report 
(you do not really need \LaTeX\ for your reports), 
remove this part (part **Equations**) and try to knit 
your Rmd-file. 

### Footnotes

Here is the use of a footnote^[This is a footnote.]. 

### Images
Want an image? This will do it. 
To depict an image (say, `my_image.jpg` which should be in your current working directory), use this command 

![caption for my image](my_image.jpg)

### Tables

Want a table? This will create one (note that the separators 
*do not* have to be aligned).

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4 


You can also make table by using knit's `kable` function:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5,],caption="A knit kable.")
```

### Block quote
> This will create a block quote, 
> if you want one.

### Verbatim
```
This text is displayed verbatim/preformatted.
```

### Links
Links: http://example.com, [in-text link to Google](http://google.com),
[linked phrase](http://example.com).

### Italicized and embolded text
- Single asterisks italicize text *like this*. 
- Double asterisks embolden text **like this**.

One more way: _italic_ and __bold__.

## \textcolor{blue}{Exercises}

### Exercise 1

**(i)** Here are some consequitive R-commands.
```{r}
x=rep(c("A","B"),each=5); x
sample(x)
x=rnorm(100)
```
Now the same code chunk but with all the output collapsed into signle block.
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
x=rep(c("A","B"),each=5); x
sample(x)
x=rnorm(100)
```

**(ii)** Below we perform a one sample t-test for the artificial date 
(that we generated ourselves).
```{r}
mu=0.2
x=rnorm(100,mu,1) # creating artificial data
t.test(x,mean=0)   # t.test(x,alternative=c("two.sided"),conf.level=0.95,mu=10)
```

**(iii)** We often do not need to report the whole output of R-commands, 
only certain values of the output. For example, below we perform 
a two-sample t-test and report only the (appropriately rounded) values 
of t-statistics and the p-pavue.

```{r}
mu=0;nu=0.5
x=rnorm(50,mu,1); y=rnorm(50,nu,1) # creating artificial data
ttest=t.test(x,y) 
```

The value of t-statistics in the above evaluation is  
`r round(ttest[[1]],2)` and the p-value is `r round(ttest[[3]],4)`.
